The password checker serves as a tool to assess the strength of passwords based on predefined criteria, including length, character complexity, and adherence to specific patterns. To implement it in Python, define the criteria, create a checking function to evaluate passwords against these criteria, and optionally provide feedback on their strength. Testing ensures the checker functions accurately across various password scenarios. Users can utilize the checker by specifying criteria like minimum length and required character types, receiving feedback on password strength. Emphasize the importance of strong, unique passwords and consider additional security measures like multi-factor authentication for enhanced protection.
